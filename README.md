Welcome to the "Scientific Communication Project" repository! This project aims to provide an introduction to programming in Python for individuals who have little to no prior programming experience. The Jupyter Notebook in this repository contains four examples that cover basic Python commands, such as creating variables, functions, operations and using conditionals such as "for" and "while" loops. These examples are useful for begginers to start their journey in the world of Python programming.


Python is one of the most used programming language known for its simplicity. It has gaines significant popularity in many domains, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence and bioinformatics among others. Python's extensive library and community make it a good choice for both begineers and experienced programmers.

However, learning a new programming language can be a challenge, especially for persons without prior coding knowledge. Understanding new programming concepts can initially feel overwhelming and hard. Existing ressources assume a certain level of knowledge or familiarity with programming. This can make it difficult for begginers to initiate.

The state of the art in introductory Python resources often lacks begginer materials that provide an easy introduction to programming concepts. Many tutorials dive directly into difficult topics without giving a strong base. This can discourage begginers and reduce their learning progress.

Furthermore, some materials may not offer examples which can make it challenging for new programmers to learn practical skills.

In order to avoid these limitations, this project offers the following ideas for improving the state of ther art in introductory Python ressources:

Firstly, it provides a step-by-step approach that introduces slowly programming concepts, starting from the beginning and advancing in a logical manner. This allows new programmers to better understand each idea before approaching the next level.

Secondly, the notebook incorporates interactive examples that encourage active learning.

And finally, the student is able to practice with some exercises from the wiki part.

Feel free to explore the Jupyther Notebook and start your Python learning adventure!
